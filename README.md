## Project Title:
Bike-Share Usage Analysis: Understanding Rider Behavior to Increase Membership Conversions

## Business Task
A bike-share company wants to better understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. The goal is to use data to identify patterns, uncover usage trends, and provide recommendations that can help convert more casual riders into annual members.

## Key Questions (SMART Framing)
### Primary Question
1. How do usage patterns differ between casual riders and annual members, and what strategies can increase conversions to annual memberships?

### Supporting Questions
1. When do riders take trips (time of day, day of week, month/season)?
2. Where do trips begin and end? Are certain stations more popular for casual riders vs members?
3. How long do trips last for each rider type?
4. Do casual riders tend to take more weekend or leisure-oriented trips?
5. Are annual members more consistent in commute times or trip duration?
6. What trends appear across the year (seasonality patterns)?
7. Which user group rides more overall?
8. What opportunities exist to improve casual-to-member conversion?

## Stakeholders
### Primary Stakeholder:
1. Bike-share Company (Marketing & Strategy Team)

### Secondary Stakeholders:
1. Operations team (resource allocation, bike distribution)
2. Data analytics team
3. End users (riders – casual & members)
4. Local transportation partners (city planning, tourism)
   
## Success Metrics
A successful analysis will produce:

### Analytical Outcomes
1. A cleaned, validated dataset representing at least 12 months of rides
2. Clear quantitative comparison between casual and member rider behavior
3. Charts showing usage trends, ride lengths, seasonality, and station popularity
4. SQL, spreadsheet, and R artifacts demonstrating technical skill

### Business Outcomes
1. Clear, evidence-based recommendations to:
2. Increase annual membership conversions
3. Improve marketing targeting
4. Optimize resource allocation
5. Tailor promotions to peak usage patterns

### Portfolio Outcomes
1. Publishable GitHub repository with:
2. Documentation for every step
3. SQL files
4. R scripts
5. Clean and processed datasets
6. Visualizations and summary insights
7. A professional final report summarizing findings

## Assumptions
1. Dataset is accurate and representative of real bike-share usage.
2. Data covers at least 12 months to capture seasonality.
3. Rider privacy is protected (data is anonymized).
4. Business wants insights primarily to increase membership conversions.

## Constraints
1. Data may have missing or inconsistent timestamps
2. GPS coordinates may not match a complete station list
3. Trip durations may include erroneous values (negative or extremely high); these must be cleaned
4. Public dataset may lack demographic factors

## Final Summary Statement
This project will apply the Google Data Analytics workflow to uncover meaningful insights into bike-share usage patterns. By comparing behaviors of casual vs annual riders, the analysis will support targeted business strategies aimed at increasing annual memberships, improving rider experience, and optimizing daily operations.

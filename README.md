📌 Project Title:

Bike-Share Usage Analysis: Understanding Rider Behavior to Increase Membership Conversions

📌 Business Task

A bike-share company wants to better understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. The goal is to use data to identify patterns, uncover usage trends, and provide recommendations that can help convert more casual riders into annual members.

📌 Key Questions (SMART Framing)
🎯 Primary Question

How do usage patterns differ between casual riders and annual members, and what strategies can increase conversions to annual memberships?

🔍 Supporting Questions

When do riders take trips (time of day, day of week, month/season)?

Where do trips begin and end? Are certain stations more popular for casual riders vs members?

How long do trips last for each rider type?

Do casual riders tend to take more weekend or leisure-oriented trips?

Are annual members more consistent in commute times or trip duration?

What trends appear across the year (seasonality patterns)?

Which user group rides more overall?

What opportunities exist to improve casual-to-member conversion?

📌 Stakeholders

Primary Stakeholder:
Bike-share Company (Marketing & Strategy Team)

Secondary Stakeholders:

Operations team (resource allocation, bike distribution)

Data analytics team

End users (riders – casual & members)

Local transportation partners (city planning, tourism)

📌 Success Metrics

A successful analysis will produce:

🎯 Analytical Outcomes

Optimize resource allocation

Tailor promotions to peak usage patterns

🎯 Portfolio Outcomes

Publishable GitHub repository with:

Documentation for every step

SQL files

R scripts

Clean and processed datasets

Visualizations and summary insights

A professional final report summarizing findings

📌 Assumptions

Dataset is accurate and representative of real bike-share usage.

Data covers at least 12 months to capture seasonality.

Rider privacy is protected (data is anonymized).

Business wants insights primarily to increase membership conversions.

📌 Constraints

Data may have missing or inconsistent timestamps

GPS coordinates may not match a complete station list

Trip durations may include erroneous values (negative or extremely high); these must be cleaned

Public dataset may lack demographic factors

📌 Final Summary Statement

This project will apply the Google Data Analytics workflow to uncover meaningful insights into bike-share usage patterns. By comparing behaviors of casual vs annual riders, the analysis will support targeted business strategies aimed at increasing annual memberships, improving rider experience, and optimizing daily operations.
